%% Description
% The drawLA Toolbox was created to facilitate visualization of the basic
% concepts of Linear Algebra. It is a collection of MATLAB functions for easy
% plotting of 2D/3D vectors, planes, lines and spheres, and... displaying matrix
% equations.

%% Toolbox content
% There are 12 functions in the toolbox. 
%
% 10 of them produce 2D/3D plots of geometric objects:
%
% # drawVector.m  - Draw 2D/3D vector(s).
% # drawPlane.m   - Draw 2D/3D plane.
% # drawSpan.m    - Draw line(2D)/plane(3D) spanned by one (2D/3D) or two (3D) vectors.
% # drawLine.m    - Draw 2D/3D line between two points.
% # drawXLine.m   - Draw vertical line in xy-plane at given x value.
% # drawYLine.m   - Draw horizontal line in xy-plane at given y value.
% # drawCircle.m  - Draw circle(s) in a xy-plane plot.
% # drawAxes.m    - Draw 2D/3D coordinate axes lines.
% # drawSphere.m  - Draw unit 2D/3D sphere under a linear (affine) transformation.
% # drawMesh.m    - Plot a polygonal 2D/3D mesh.
%
% The other 2 are auxiliary function for:
%
% # dispMEq     - Formatted display of a matrix equation.
% # drawGraph   - Draw small directed graph with up to 6 nodes.
%
% Each function is provided with a help and examples of its usage, which can be
% displayed by typing |help _function name_| in the command window. E.g., |help
% drawPlane|.
